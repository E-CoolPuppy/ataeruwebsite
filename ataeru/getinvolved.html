						<h2><li>we collaborate.</li></h2>
						<p>Based in New York City, the hub of diversity, we want different people who bring different ideas to the table. We encourage communication and teamwork between our employees, and <em>embrace</em> differences, not reject them. After all, collaboration is the key to growth and success. We don’t expect you to be like everyone else – just be yourself, and we’ll work together to find the best solution. </p>
						<h2><li>we focus on impact.</li></h2>
						<p>We’re striving to help the global population as much as we can, regardless of their background, socioeconomic status, and location. To do this, we’ve started tackling the common affliction of food allergies. However, we’re constantly searching for ways to maximize impact and expand accessibility to our solutions. With these goals in mind, we’re not afraid to dream big and work to make it happen.</p>
						<h2><li>we have a positive feedback culture.</li></h2>
						<p>As a healthcare company, it’s our responsibility that we ensure the health and wellbeing of the customer first and foremost. To promote that, we have a positive feedback culture, where anyone can feel free to give thoughts and opinions in an honest, respectful, and thoughtful manner. With this, we’re able to foster the most growth through the company, helping everyone to be their best selves in the workplace.</p>
